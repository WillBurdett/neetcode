   *
   * You are given an array of length `n` that was originally sorted in ascending order and has now been rotated
   * between 1 and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6]` might become:

   * [3,4,5,6,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
   * [1,2,3,4,5,6] if it was rotated 6 times.

   * Notice that rotating the array 4 times moves the last four elements of the array to the beginning. Rotating
   * the array 6 times produces the original array.
   *
   * Assuming all elements in the rotated sorted array `nums` are unique, return the minimum element of this array.
   *
   * A solution that runs in O(n) time is trivial; can you write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time?
